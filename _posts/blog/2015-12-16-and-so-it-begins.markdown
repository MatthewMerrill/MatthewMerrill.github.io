<h4>Perhaps I should introduce myself...</h4>
My name is Matthew Merrill. At this time of writing, I am a Sacramento State Computer Science Undergraduate in the finals week of my first semester.
I have been coding since 7th grade, and enjoy learning technologies as I tackle projects (like this one!).

<h4>What is this site?</h4>
In this website, I hope to learn more about web development while developing a platform for me to shout at the world.
Some planned content includes Electronics projects and Minecraft coding tutorials.
Who knows, perhaps one day I'll use this site to document a game-developing expedition.
